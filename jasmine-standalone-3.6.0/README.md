### Thermostat

```
As a user
To have control of my temperature
I would like my thermostat to start at 20 degrees
```
```
As a user
To make my room warmer
I would like to increase my temperature on the thermostat
```
```
As a user
To make my room colder
I would like to decrease my temperature on the thermostat
```

```
As a user
So I won't freeze to death
I don't want my temperature to go lower than 10 degrees. EVER.
```
```
As a user
Because I love my planet
I want to turn power saving mode on and have 25 degrees as the maximum
```

If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
Power saving mode is on by default but it can also be turned off
You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, <= 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.
(In the challenges where we add an interface, low-usage will be indicated with green, medium-usage indicated with black, high-usage indicated with red.)
